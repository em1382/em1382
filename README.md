Hello, I'm Ellis. I work for Bit 49 (https://bit49.io) as a software engineer.

I graduated from Messiah College in 2019 with a B.S. in computer and information science with a focus in software development.

I enjoy people watching, muscle cars, and the aestheticism of empty places.
- I like cats more than dogs.
- My favorite flavor of ice cream is peanut butter ripple.
- This is my GitHub, not a dating profile, but you never know.
