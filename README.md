Hello, I'm Ellis.

I work for Bit 49 (https://bit49.io) as a software engineer.
I graduated from Messiah College in 2019 with a B.S. in computer and information science with a focus in software development.

I enjoy people watching, driving too fast on public roads in my Mustang, and the aestheticism of empty places. This is my GitHub, not a dating profile, but you never know ;)
