Hello, my name is Ellis Madagan. I like working on interesting projects and solving interesting problems.
- I'm currently working on a SaaS application at a supply chain company.
- I'm currently learning Java in a back-end web context (I really only used it academically before).
- I'm looking to collaborate on medical, financial, or defense technology.
- Fun fact: I once hacked my school's online food ordering system. I think it's still vulnerable.
