Hello, I'm Ellis. I enjoy strong coffee, spending time in nature, and writing (*insert buzzwords*) software. I work for Robots and Pencils as a full-stack developer.
- ðŸ›  I'm currently working on a full-stack web application (with possibly some mobile development down the road).
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning Flutter, something somewhat outside of my comfort zone!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I actually *like* brussel sprouts.
