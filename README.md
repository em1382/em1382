Hello, I'm Ellis. I work for Revolve Labs (https://revolvelabs.ai/) as a software engineer.

I graduated from Messiah College in 2019 with a B.S. in computer and information science with a focus in software development. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family, niche-ish hobbies, and traveling (near and far).

I'm saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ! If you haven't ever heard the Good News, [I'd give John 3 a read](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JHN.3.NLT). Jesus Christ (God's only Son) died for you to take away God's just punishment for your sins after death.
> “There is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God’s one and only Son. And the judgment is based on this fact: God’s light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil. All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed. But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see that they are doing what God wants.”

> John 3:16-21

One day neither you nor I will deal with bugs, PR's, or endless CVEs. But we will face judgement. It's a much more important meeting than daily stand-up, and, depending on your relationship with Christ, much more terrifying than a code review on some crunch work by your tech lead.
