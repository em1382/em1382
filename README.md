Hello, I'm Ellis. I work for Bit 49 (https://bit49.io) as a software engineer.

I graduated from Messiah College in 2019 with a B.S. in computer and information science with a focus in software development.

I enjoy people watching, driving my V8 too fast on public roads, and the aestheticism of empty places. #brogrammer. I like cats more than dogs. My favorite flavor of ice cream is peanut butter ripple. (This is my GitHub, not a dating profile, but you never know).
